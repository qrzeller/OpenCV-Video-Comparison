build_utils
============================

There is a lot of boiler plate code I would write over and over for my projects,
especially when I try to support both ``python2`` and ``python3``. This project
aims to simplify it and allows me to easily add update/improvements to all of my
projects at once.

Install
-----------

pip
~~~~~

The recommended way to install this library is::

	pip install build_utils

Development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you wish to develop and submit git-pulls, you can do::

	git clone https://github.com/walchko/build_utils
	cd build_utils
	pip install -e .

Usage
--------

To use this package, add the following to your ``setup.py``:

.. code-block:: python

	PACKAGE_NAME = 'build_utils'
	BuildCommand.pkg = PACKAGE_NAME
	BuildCommand.test = False
	PublishCommand.pkg = PACKAGE_NAME
	PublishCommand.version = VERSION

Take a look at the setup for this library on ``github`` for an example. Note
that by default, testing and both py2 and py3 are ``True`` by default.
Now you can build and publish a new package by::

	python setup.py make
	python setup.py publish
