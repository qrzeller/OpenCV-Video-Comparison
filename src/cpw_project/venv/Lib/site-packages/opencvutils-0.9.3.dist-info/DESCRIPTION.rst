This is  a set of OpenCV utilities that should make working with OpenCV a little
easier.

**Original Author:** Adrian Rosebrock

**Original Name:** `imutils <https://github.com/jrosebr1/imutils>`_


Install
--------

The preferred way to install is using ``pip``::

	pip install opencvutils

Other Libraries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You will need both ``numpy`` and ``opencv3`` for this to work. Use your os package
manager to install. Unfortunately this is not fast, ``numpy`` install involves
compiling things, so go grab a coffee or something while you wait.

for macOS::

	pip install numpy
	brew install opencv3 --with-ffmpeg --with-tbb --without-numpy
	brew link -f opencv3

there are other options that would work too.

Development
------------

To submit git pulls, clone the repository and set it up as follows::

	git clone https://github.com/walchko/opencvutils
	cd opencvutils
	pip install -e .

Documentation
---------------

See the `Jupyter Notebooks <https://github.com/walchko/opencvutils/tree/master/docs>`_
for examples of how to use this library. It contains a lot of common image manipulations.

Video
~~~~~~~

You can make a video like this:

.. code-block:: python

	import cv2
	from opencvutils.Camera import SaveVideo

	shape = (240,320)  # rows (height), cols (width)
	sv = SaveVideo()

	# you can change the default encoder using a four_cc string
	# sv.encoder('H264')
	# sv.encoder('MP4V')
	# sv.encoder('x264')

	sv.open(filename, shape[1], shape[0])  # order is backwards from opencv!!!!

	for i in range(100):
		ret, img = camera.read()  # grab image
		sv.write(img)

	sv.release()

Scripts
~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

	pi@raspberry ~ $ mjpeg_server.py -h
		usage: mjpeg_server.py [-h] [-v] [-p PORT] [-c CAMERA] [-t TYPE]
												 [-s SIZE SIZE]

		A simple mjpeg server Example: mjpeg-server -p 8080 --camera 4

		optional arguments:
		-h, --help            show this help message and exit
		-v, --version         show program's version number and exit
		-p PORT, --port PORT  mjpeg publisher port, default is 9000
		-c CAMERA, --camera CAMERA
													set opencv camera number, ex. -c 1
		-t TYPE, --type TYPE  set camera type, either pi or cv, ex. -t pi
		-s SIZE SIZE, --size SIZE SIZE
													set size
Then you could do::

	pi@raspberry ~ $ mjpeg_server.py -t pi -s 640 480

now navigate to your computer (hostname:9000) and you should see the mjpg stream.
Note, if you changed the port number with the ``-p`` arg, then use that port
number.
